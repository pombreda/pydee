# Important #

Beta-testing Pydee is a very healthy activity: we highly recommend to do it as often as possible.


# How to test Pydee #

## Installing ##

It is recommended to test only the released versions of Pydee (i.e. if you have synchronized with the Pydee Mercurial repository, please test only revisions which are tagged). In other words, simply install the latest release available here: http://code.google.com/p/pydee/downloads/list.

## Troubleshooting ##

If Pydee won't open at all:

  * Try to remove Pydee configuration file ('.pydee.ini' in your home directory)
  * If it still doesn't work, use option -d or --debug to show tracebacks (note that in debug mode, the interpreter won't be working but the tracebacks will be visible in your command shell)
