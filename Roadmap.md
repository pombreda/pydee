## Version 0.4 / May-Aug. 2009 ##

Pydee 0.4.x releases will be development snapshots, i.e. with new features and unfortunately new bugs for each new version.
When all v1.0.0 features will be implemented (probably in July), v1.0.0 alpha, beta and release candidate versions will be released.

## Version 1.0 / Sept.-Oct. 2009 ##

New features since v0.4.0:
  * Navigation keyboard shortcuts (see [Issue 29](http://code.google.com/p/pydee/issues/detail?id=29))
  * **Editor**:
    * vertical/horizontal splitting capabilities
    * _pylint_ integration
  * **History log**: 3 history logs instead of one (interactive console, external console/Python, external console/Terminal)
  * **External console**: terminal emulation (support of ANSI escape codes and keyboard interruptions)
  * Documentation

Optional new features (depends on how much time will be needed to code them):
  * **External console**: real introspection capabilities (like interactive console: doc viewer, completion), globals browser (like interactive console's _workspace_)
  * **_IPython_ integration**, as an option (see [IPythonIntegration](IPythonIntegration.md))
